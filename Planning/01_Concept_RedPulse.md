# Project Charter: Red Pulse

## Vision
**Red Pulse** is a high-frequency China intelligence platform designed for American decision-makers. It moves beyond passive news aggregation ("what happened yesterday") to **signal intelligence** ("what is happening right now").

## Core Philosophy
1.  **Signal over Noise**: We do not index every article. We capture *data points* that precede news (prices, traffic, regulatory document counts).
2.  **Ritual over Content**: In political analysis, we measure the *variance* in official language, not just the content, to predict policy shifts.
3.  **Speed**: The system is built on an asynchronous engine to process thousands of sources hourly.
4.  **Global Scope**: We monitor the *proxy war*—Chinese influence in third-party countries (Africa, SE Asia, LatAm).

## Target Audience
-   Investment Professionals (Hedge Funds, PE)
-   Corporate Strategy Teams (Supply Chain Risk)
-   Geopolitical Analysts
-   Government/Defense Stakeholders

## The "Defcon Board" Metaphor
The UI is not a feed. It is a dashboard of indicators (Green/Yellow/Red) representing supply chain health, political volatility, and diplomatic friction.
